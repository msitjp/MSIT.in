                                        The Electrical & Electronics Engineering Department at MSIT is fully equipped with state-of-the-art equipment in its various laboratories to provide research experiences and training which supports the concepts learnt in theory subjects of course curriculum.
                                        The department currently offers two laboratory courses to undergraduate students of all the branches at the college and 10 additional laboratories to undergraduate students of EEE branch exclusively.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="labContent">
                                        The department is quite boastful about a few hardware laboratories like: Machine Lab, Power System Lab, Measurement & Instrumentation Lab, Electric Drives Lab and Power Electronics Lab.

                                        Besides the above mentioned hardware laboratories of the department, there is a computer lab with latest Intel i5 processors. This lab acts host to all software based requirements of the department. It is equipped with Matlab software package with tool
                                        packages including Neural and Fuzzy System, Image Processing, Digital Signal Processing, Control Systems and Optimization Tool Box. It has additional software namely, DigSilent Power Factory with 25 nodes for study
                                        and analysis of power system.
